# Human-Speech-Emotion-Recognition
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) entails the technique of discerning human emotions and affective states through an individual's voice or speech. This approach capitalizes on the inherent ability of voice tone and pitch to often unveil underlying emotional nuances. Its prominence has been growing within research circles, driven by its pivotal role in advancing interfaces and artificial intelligence. This, in turn, empowers machines to comprehend nuances beyond mere verbal content within human interactions. However, despite substantial strides in speech recognition, a distinct rapport between humans and machines remains elusive due to the machine's incomplete grasp of the speaker's emotional state.

Speech emotion recognition involves the extraction of an individual's emotional state from their speech patterns. This form of recognition holds the potential to extract valuable semantic insights from speech, thereby enhancing the efficacy of speech recognition systems.

The process of speech emotion detection is rooted in pattern recognition, encompassing the tasks of feature extraction, emotion classification, and regression. The community dedicated to emotion recognition is engrossed in deriving meaningful and insightful feature sets. Notably, advanced research in computerized speech emotion recognition predominantly concentrates on the paralinguistic aspects of speech. This involves the extraction of acoustic descriptors, primarily associated with prosody and spectral highlights.
